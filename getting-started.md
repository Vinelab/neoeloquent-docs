## Getting Started

In this section we intend to cover essential database operations, such as:
* [Working with Nodes](https://github.com/Vinelab/neoeloquent-docs/blob/draft-docs/working-with-nodes.md)
* [Working with Relations](https://github.com/Vinelab/neoeloquent-docs/blob/draft-docs/working-with-relations.md)

You should note that NeoEloquent follow a builder design pattern, wich mean you can chain commands in order to build complex queries.
